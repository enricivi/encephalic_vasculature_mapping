# EncephalicVasculatureMapping
This work aims to explore a new approach to model the encephalic vasculature using the formalism of graphs that naturally fit the structure of blood vessels.

To obtain the graph follow the procedure below:

1) Use train_vascular.py to train the neural network (use -h to see the script's help)
2)
